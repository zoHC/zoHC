- ⚡ Fun fact: The term "bug" in the context of computer programming originated in 1947 when computer scientist Grace Hopper found an actual moth causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer. She removed the moth and taped it to the logbook, coining the term "debugging" for the process of fixing software glitches. So, the next time you're troubleshooting code issues, you can thank a literal bug for inspiring the term! 🐞✨
